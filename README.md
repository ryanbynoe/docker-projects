# Docker Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository of Docker Projects! This collection of projects serves as a practical journey through learning Docker, containerization, and how to effectively use Docker in various development scenarios. Each project within this repo represents a step in my exploration of Docker's capabilities, from basic to more advanced uses.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning progress with Docker. It includes a variety of projects that demonstrate different Docker functionalities, such as:

- Containerizing simple applications
- Setting up multi-container applications with Docker Compose
- Implementing microservices architecture
- Exploring volume management and data persistence
- Configuring custom Docker networks for inter-container communication

These projects are designed to build a comprehensive understanding of Docker and its place in modern software development.

## Projects Overview
Here's a brief overview of some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

- **Travel Bucket List**: A more complex application demonstrating Docker Compose, involving a React frontend, Node.js backend, and MongoDB database.

- (Further projects to be added as I continue learning.)

## Getting Started
To explore these projects:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ryanbynoe/docker-projects.git
